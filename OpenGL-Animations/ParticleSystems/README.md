This subproject consists of a water simulation and fire simulation.
Both simulations support user interaction, i.e. interacting with the particle system with a sphere.
Use "wasd" keys to move the sphere perpendicular to the view direction, and use the up and down arrow keys
to drag the sphere in and out.

Source file needs to be manually switched in order to run different animations.
