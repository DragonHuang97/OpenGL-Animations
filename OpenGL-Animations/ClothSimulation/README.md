This subproject is a simulation of a piece of hanging cloth.

The cloth is textured with a University of Minnesota logo, and can react to collision and aerodynamic forces.

Users can interact with the cloth by hitting it with the sphere or controlling the speed and direction of the wind.
Press "space" key to start the simulation.
Use the "G" key to grab and release the sphere.
The camera in the simulation can be controlled with the mouse (rotate) and the "wasd" keys (translate),
and when the sphere is grabbed, it will follow the movement and rotation of the camera.
Use the left and right arrow keys to change the wind direction.
Use the up and down arrow keys to adjust the wind speed.
Press "0" key to reset wind speed to 0.
